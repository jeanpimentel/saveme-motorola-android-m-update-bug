# Save Me
ðŸ“± Simple rescue app to fix Android System after update from 5.1 to 6.0 on Motorola phones

## Problem:

- [Home button not working after flashing to Android Marshmallow](https://www.virag.si/2015/08/home-button-not-working-after-flashing-to-android-marshmallow/)

âš¡ Developer mode isn't available, so Debug Mode isn't possible and `adb` neither. So, I built this app to open an `Activity` and the problem was resolved.

## Instructions:
1. At mobile browser, download APK here: [https://github.com/jeanpimentel/saveme-motorola-android-m-update-bug/releases/download/1.0.0/saveme.apk](https://github.com/jeanpimentel/saveme-motorola-android-m-update-bug/releases/download/1.0.0/saveme.apk) or ![qrcode](qrcode.png)
2. Install
3. Open
4. Click at 'Save Me'
5. The wizard should run or an error will be displayed below the button.
6. Do the wizard and the problem will be fixed.

âš¡ If you prefer, you can download the source code, inspect the code and build your APK.
